This application enables the creation of a high quality 3D model of an archaeological artefact via process known as photo-masking. There has been a revolution in 3D modelling in recent years and it is now relatively easy to construct such models from ordinary digital photographs. 
Isolating the object depicted in these photographs, and masking out the background, is an important first step to achieving high quality results. The final 3D model will be made publicly available and is useful not only for basic documentation purposes, but also for graphical displays in museums, for inclusion in gaming and virtual reality environments, or for identifing different sub-styles in otherwise similar types of artefact (that might tell us about the date of the artefact, where it was made, or by whom).
This particular photo-masking application concerns a round stone mortar with two holes on both sides, each having a diameter of 4.6 cm. The object was found in Gird-i Bazar, part of a Neo-Assyrian settlement complex (ca. 900-600 BCE) located in the Kurdish Autonomous Region of Iraq, province of Sulaymaniyah, district of Qaladze. 
The mortar was excavated in the summer of 2016 during archaeological investigations carried out by LMU Munich's Ancient History Department, which has been running the excavation since 2015. 
The stone mortar is a specific tool, used in antiquity together with a stone pestle to prepare ingredients or substances by crushing and grinding them into a fine paste or powder. 
The present crowd-sourcing project will allow you, the public, to help the archaeologists in the documentation and dissemination of their findings as 3D models.

Stone mortars were, and sometimes still are, used with stone pestles to prepare ingredients or substances by crushing and grinding them into a fine paste or powder. With this crowd-sourcing project we are asking for your help to assist with the 3D documentation of one of these tools.


### What we want you to do

We would like people to draw a polygon around the object that they see in each photograph in order to identify its 
outline and exclude the image background. This allows the 3D modelling process to concentrate on the object itself and 
ignore irrelevant background information.

If you are interested in what our 3D completed models look like, please have a look [at our Sketchfab profile](https://sketchfab.com/micropasts).
